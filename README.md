# IOT-Colour-sensor-initial
making colour sensor capable of sensing first red, blue, green, white, black and yellow colour.
This program is an Arduino code to make colour sensor detect RGB, white, black and yellow(255,255,0) with some error range of the sensor.
It is just a general code not a advance concept 
I will be continuing to advance the code(if done you will see it in another -final repository.
